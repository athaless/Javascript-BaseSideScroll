# Javascript-BaseSideScroll
Basic side-scrolling with Javascript and CSS

A side-scrolling video game, sometimes shortened to side-scroller, is a game in which the action is viewed from a side-view camera angle, and the screen follows the player as they move left or right. The jump from single-screen or flip-screen graphics to scrolling graphics during the golden age of video arcade games was a pivotal leap in game design, comparable to the move to 3D graphics during the fifth generation.

Here we have just an implementation test with JScript and CSS

  <tr>
    <td><img src="./_/Javascript-BaseSideScroll_img01"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
